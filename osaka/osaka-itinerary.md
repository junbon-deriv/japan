## Suggestions for Itinerary Optimization

1. **Restaurant Strategy**:

   * For rainy days, prioritize indoor activities like Yodobashi Camera, shopping arcades, or longer restaurant experiences.
   * Universal Studios is mostly outdoors - have a backup plan if weather is poor.

4. **Time Management**:
   * Day 9 (Minoh Falls, Katsuoji, and city areas) is quite packed. Consider:
     * Either focusing on just Minoh Falls and city areas
     * Or visiting Katsuoji on a separate day if schedule allows

5. **Restaurant Additions**:
   * Consider adding a **kushikatsu** restaurant to your list as it's another Osaka specialty
   * **Kura Sushi** or other conveyor belt sushi could be a fun lunch option

## Final Notes
* Many restaurants in prime tourist areas like Dotonbori get extremely busy during peak hours (12:00-13:30 and 18:00-20:00). Either arrive early or be prepared to wait.
* Carry a pocket Wi-Fi or have offline maps for easier navigation between destinations.
* Most coffee shops close early (around 18:00-19:00), so plan morning or afternoon visits.
* Keep your hotel's address in Japanese to show taxi drivers if needed.
